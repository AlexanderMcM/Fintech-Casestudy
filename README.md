# FinTech Case Study
By Alexander McMullan 

## Overview and Origin:

*  Stripe, Inc.

* In 2009 Stripe was founded and incorporated in Palo Alto, California,USA, and launched publicly in 2011.

* John and Partrick Collison (Two Enterpreneur brothers from Ireland), founded the company.

* The idea of Stripe came about because of the problems Internet/E-commerce businesses stumble upon when starting and operating their online business. In fact Stripe wasn't the first successs story Patrick Collison has had. In 2007 he founded AUctomatic (A software company to help Ebay sellers manage their listings and inventory), and were accepted into start-up seed money accelerator Y Combinator, 10 months in and only at the age of 19 the company was bough by Live Current Media for $5 million dollars. After working on Auctomatic they saw the problem with payment platforms like Paypal that better suited individuals and not startups. 
Financial barriers are immense, business/startups can’t devote enough time on their products because of the complexities of payment routing, reporting and currencies exchanges. The idea of stripe was to relieve and simplify the financial technology workload that their customers have, so they can focus on growing or starting their businesses.

*  From 2010-2011 Stripe was first funded in a seed round from Y Combinator (A US seed money accelerator) and Peter Thiel (Paypal co-founder) worth $2 million dollars.
From 2012-2014 Stripe received funding totalling $376 million dollars from Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund and Thrive Capital (Venture Capital firms). From 2016-2019 Stripe received funding totaling $745 million dollars from, CapitalG,General Catalyst, Tiger Global Management, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz (US Venture capital firms). 
In 2020-2021 Stripe received a total of $1.2 Billion Dollars, $600 Million from Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst, Google ventures and Andreessen Horowitz in 2020. And $600 million from Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency, Insurers Allianz SE, AXA SA, and Investment firms Gifford &Co and Fidelity Investments in 2021. All together Stripe has received $2.3 Billion dollars in funding, and has reached a $95 Billion dollar valuation as of March 2021.  

## Buissness Activites 



* Stripe’s goal is to help buissneses simplify their payment systems and manage their business online. By utilizing Stripes software Applications, cloud-based infrastructure and buissnes credit card platform; businesses of all sizes are able to easily manage revenue, prevent fraud, and expand their e-commerce reach. Stripe’s finachial technology provides reliability, scalability and most importantly security for their customers. Their misson according to their co-founder John Collison Is, "increasing the GDP of the internet"-CNBC.


* Stripe’s intended customer is small startups to Fortune 500 giants. Millions of companies in over 120 countries already use Stripe to start,run and scale their businesses. Including most notably Amazon,Google, Shopify, DIDI,Uber and Slack. Stripe's customer market size could continue to grow, with businesses in every industry expanding their online reach to create seamless checkout systems for their customers. 

* Stripe offers some key solutions that give them a “unfair” advantage compared to their competitors. Stripe offers a full integrated payment stack that allows companies to build an online marketplace/payment operations from the ground up. Compared to Paypal, Stripe also offers customers more customizable systems and services that can be tailored to individual customers needs. Stripe also recently introduced “Issuing” an API (Application User Interface) that allows customers to create and control virtual and physical cards. Companies like Postmates use Issuing to allow couriers to pay for orders without allowing unapproved purchases. This has become a huge advantage for Stripe over their competitors, because it’s one aspect of the payment ecosystem they’ve created for their customers, over competitors. If a company already uses Stripe for their payment process, platforms like Isussing and Stripe’s seamless payment process induces customers to stay within the Stripe payment ecosystem. 


* Stripe uses a variety of Technologies in their Applications and Payment Platforms. The following are Stripe’s Applications overview/technology used: “Radar” - A fraud detection service, uses machine learning that detects and blocks fraud for their customers. Stripe’s machine learning infrastructure allows them to retrain models/Radar algorithms to adapt quickly to shifting fraud patterns for each unique customer.
“Sigma” - Is a fully customizable SQL ( Structured Query Language) tool that eliminates the need for Stripe customers to build their own Data analytics. Sigma allows Stripes customers to write SQL queries to create custom reports and get instant answers.
“Billing” -  Allows Stripe’s customers to simplify one-time and recurring billing for SaaS (Software as as Service) and other subscription-based products. Billing uses a unique API (Application Programming Interface) that integrates seamlessly with existing websites,mobile apps, and CRM(Customer Relationship Management) Systems. 
Atlas - Provides an end to end business formation service allowing anyone in the world to start a business. Atlas allows Stripes customers to Form a legal entity, Issue stock to founders, Discounts and access to Stripe Account to start accepting payments from customers in 100+ currencies. Atlas uses a mix of API’s, machine learning algorithms, libraries and SDKs (Software Development Kits).
Stripe’s Payment Platforms: “Payments” - Accepts payments and moves money globally with Stripe’s APIs, and software solutions. Payments uses Stripes prebuilt and customizable APIs, SDKS to securely accept payments, in minutes. Payments also uses Stripe Elements- a prebuilt UI(User Interface) components that allows customers to design their own payments form on their site. “Connect” - A payment platform for Online Marketplaces. Connect is a set of programmable API’s that facilitates payments of Stripe’s customers software platform, allows them to build a marketplace and payout sellers. Connect allows customers to verify users through their prebuilt UIs (User Interface systems) or allows the user to build their own custom flows. Connect pays out users seamsely with Connect’s global routing and payout engine, allowing customers to split funds between multiple merchants and users, and instantly route payments across borders and specify earnings on each transaction. Connects gives customers from start-ups to global companies prebuilt API’S and code samples while also flexibility to tweak programs or build them in house.



## Landscape 

* Stripe operates as a Financial service and a software as a service (SaaS) company. 

* The major trends and innovations in Stripe’s domain have seen exponential growth over the last 5-10 years. From 2011-2021 E-commerce has become a major part of retail consumers daily life, with the growth of  E-commerce giants such as  Amazon, Uber/Lyft and Shopify(All Stripe customers). The need for seamless, secure and fast online payment processes has become a necessity for businesses and people who use their services online on a daily basis. The softwares/code that Stripe has created for companies to accept payment online has become used so frequently, that in 2018 alone, it’s estimated that half of Americans that spend a dollar online use Stripe. In the past 5 years the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this growth,  and has nearly doubled Stripe’s valuation to $95 Billion in the past year alone from $26 Billion(2020-2021). 

* Other major companies competing in the domain include: Paypal (USA), Authorize. Net (USA), Square (USA), Adyen (Netherlands), 2Checkout (USA), Ant Financial (China), Braintree (By Paypal USA), PayJunction (USA) and Fattmerchant (USA).

## Results

* Stripe’s business impact has been immense, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic upended traditional commerce. Before the pandemic we bought 16% of things online, now most of us buy 34% of things online. And 2018 alone, it’s estimated that half of Americans that spend a dollar online use Stripe. Obviously that has grown since the start of COVID-19, but it goes to show the impact Stripe has over our daily transaction online. What’s most surprising about Stripe's impact is how they operate in Huge and growing Companies such as Amazon, Uber, Shopify, Postmates and Wayfair, and yet are still very unknown to the general public. These companies that operate solely online and enable huge trust in their users to send money over the internet, are in fact using Stripes infrastructure and Technology. If you were to ask an average person on the street if they knew what Stripe is or does, they probably wouldn't know, but the probability of them already having used Stripe's payment infastructure through on of their many customers existing customer, to buy something online is very high.


* Stripe has grown tremendously over the last 5 years. In 2020 Stripe was named CNBC’S No.1 Disruptor company, out of 50 competing companies. The COVID-19 pandemic is also a factor in the growth and success of the company, with more people using E-Commerce to buy products, Stripe has only benefited in the shift from brick and mortar to Online E-Commerce. Stripe was also able to double their valuation, as they received an additional $600 million in Equity from Venture Funds Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and Sequoia in April 2020.


* Stripe is very similar in the offerings they have compared to Competitors, PayPal, Aurthoize.Net and Square, and yet they have grown their product offering to distinguish themselves as the “Payments infrastructure for the internet”. From being a company whose primary product was to copy a few lines of code, to start accepting one-off payments online. Stripe has broadened their Online Payment Ecosystem to include online and offline payment systems, Data analytics, Virtual/physical cards, subscription/invoice payments and payouts to service providers, sellers and freelancers for their customers. Stripe countries to grow in house applications and services that keep their customers never having to leave their ecosystem. Unlike their competitors who are growing their retail footprint, like Square with payment app CashApp, and Paypal with their Venmo. Stripe counties to service their niche of online business, of Enterprises to Start-ups. This has cemented themselves as the go-to for anyone trying to start a business or expand their existing, unlike their competitors. 

## Recomendations 
 
* If I were to advise Stripe, I would suggest they create an online banking platform for retail consumers. A platform similar to what Square operates, that would allow retail customers to have a digital Stripe wallet,Stripe Credit cards/debit cards and an easy to use app to send money.


* If Stripe were to offer such a service it would benefit the company in two ways. Firstly, Stripe is a well-known company in the world of Start-ups and large internet companies. But Stripe is also fairly unknown and a mystery to retail consumers. Even for those who use Stripe’s payment infrastructure on multiple websites, they still have no idea what the company does, or the fact that Stripe is the power behind their purchase online. If Stripe were to have an online banking system for retail customers it would bolster their image and name recognition, and would also cut fees that Stripe already pays to Banks and credit cards. When Stripe charges a start up or Enterprise for their payment infrastructure, they typically charge 2.9% + 30cents of the total value, after paying banks and credit cards Stripe's take rate is typically somewhere between 0.5-1% of the transaction value. If Stripe were to offer their own Banking and credit card services to Retail Customers, they would gain more profit for each transaction by cutting out existing Banks and credit cards. While also building brand recognition among retail consumers, some of whom already trust them with their money already, and just don’t know it. I think an online banking platform could be really successful for Stripe. For example “Tangerine was the highest rated mid-size bank for the tenth consecutive year”-CTV news, Tangerine is a bank that operates primarily online, has no ATMS and offers very little brick and mortar locations. Growing dissent for traditional banks is growing, while the need for a seamless, smart online bank you can simply access through your phone is growing. Stripe is in a perfect position to create an excellent online banking platform for retail customers.

* Stripe, operating an online banking system for retail customers, wouldn’t require any additional technology but would just require retooling of their already existing technology in use. For instance Stripe has a service called “Issuing” that creates Virtual and Physical cards that use an API(Application Programming Interface) for business. Stripe also offers “Treasury” a banking-as-service API that lets you embed financial services in your marketplaces or platform. “Treasury” allows Stripes Business customers to hold funds, pay bills, earn interest, and manage Cash Flow. Both “Issuing” and “Treasury” could easily be retooled and merged to create virtual and physical credit cards/debit cards, send money, pay bills, earn interest and transfer money to different countries/currencies for retail customers' banking needs.
